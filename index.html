                Hi, I'm Michaela. I'm new web developer based in Minneapolis. I have a degree in Early Childhood Education from the University 
                of Minnesota and have been working as a nanny for the same two families for the past five years. When I'm not learning how to code or 
                taking care of the kids, I like to hike and travel, garden, and enjoy live music. I live with my husband RJ and two cats, Pippin and Luna.
                I'm planning on transitioning into a full-time front-end web development career soon!  
            </p1>
